Background
The prefrontal-cortex (PFC) occupies about one-third of the total area of the cerebral cortex and it plays crucial role in Cognition and memory. This study evaluated the ameliorative effects of aqueous extract of Colocasia esculenta leaf (AECEL) on lipopolysaccharide-induced Prefrontal-cortex damage.

Methods
42 Swiss male albino mice with weights ranging between 18 − 22g were randomized into six-groups. Group-A consisted of healthy-mice and LPS-induction in groups (B-F) was done by intraperitoneal injections of 0.5mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for seven days. Group-B received distilled-water; Group C- E was treated with AECEL at 400 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg respectively, while Group F received 2.5 mg/kg of donepezil (DPZ) via oral-gavage for 28days.

Results
Significant increase in the brain oxidative-stress parameters was seen in the LPS-exposed groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). However, compared with those in the LPS-only group, the levels of oxidative-stress parameters as well as Tumour-necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the brain of AECEL-and DPZ-treated groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05). In the Y-maze test: the percentage-alternation (%ALTERN) significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the LPS-only group compared to that in the control-group, but there was a significant increase in the %ALTERN in the AECEL-treated groups compared to that in the LPS-only and LPS + DPZ treatment groups (p < 0.05). Bielschowsky staining revealed that the LPS-only group exhibited senile-plaques and neurofibrillary-tangles.

Conclusion
LPS caused damage to the PFC; AECEL significantly improved cognitive function, memory, and anxiety-like behaviours.
