Welcome to my page! I am committed to unraveling the mysteries of the brain and exploring its complex intricacies. With a strong academic background in Human Anatomy, specifically focused on Neuroscience, I've dedicated my career to understanding the complexities of neural systems.
My journey began in empirical neuroscience, where I delved into the intricate workings of the brain through hands-on exploration. From dissecting various animal brains, ranging from rodents to wild boar, I gained invaluable insights into the anatomical nuances underpinning neural function.
Additionally, as a professional designer, I use a creative mindset to combine science with innovative design principles to communicate complex ideas effectively.

Research Background
======
My research endeavors have been multifaceted, spanning various laboratory techniques such as behavioral studies on rodents, microscopy in histopathological studies, and biochemical assays of different brain regions. Through these techniques, I've investigated the mechanisms of cognition and how they are influenced by neurodegenerative processes. My studies have also included the use of computational techniques in molecular and cellular neuroscience, such as molecular dynamics and simulation of protein-ligand interactions, to study the potential of certain phytocompounds as therapeutic agents against neurodegenerative symptoms and conditions.

Transition to Computational Neuroscience
======
Driven by a desire to delve deeper into the neural mechanisms of the brain, my focus was fully transitioned to computational neuroscience. By combining my strong background in neuroanatomy with newfound expertise in modeling neural networks, I aim to uncover novel insights into the computational principles of the brain. Moving forward, I aim to explore the intersection of neuroscience, computation, and cognition. I am always eager to apply my skills in computational neuroscience to study neural dynamics, unravel complex cognitive processes, and explore potential therapeutic interventions for neurological disorders.
To enhance my understanding of computational neuroscience, I actively participate in workshops, courses, and training programs focused on modeling neural networks. These experiences provide me with the tools and knowledge necessary to tackle the most pressing questions in the field. Thank you for visiting my page. You can explore my very few projects on my GitHub to join me on this journey of discovery.

In my leisure time, I sometimes explore the captivating world of anime and triple-A games. I do enjoy analyzing and sharing my insights on various anime series on globally renowned entertainment websites like [CBR.com](https://www.cbr.com/author/tolu-oladele/).
